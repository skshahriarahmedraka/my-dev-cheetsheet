# structure of cosmos-sdk 


## anatomy of cosmos-sdk application

- node client 
- core application file 
- context 
- multistore
- modules 
- application interface 
- dependencies and makefile 



## node client

core process of comos-sdk based block chain 

- initizlize state-machine
- connect with other full nodes 
- update their sate machine new blocks 


on node startup :

- create instance of the state machine defined in app.go 
- initialize state machine with latest know state 
- create and start a new comet BFT instance : handshake with peers,get latest block height and replay blocks to sync to it

types of client note :

- archive node 
- pruned node 
- inactive validator 
- active validator

folder structure :

- /config 
- /data
- /keyring

api endpoints :

- application HTTP server port 1317 
- application gRPC server port 9090
- cometBFT RPC server port 26657
- cometBFT p2p port 26656
- prometheus port 26660
- pprof port 6060


core application file :

the core of state machine is defined in a file called app.go

contains :
- type defination of application
- funcitons to create initialize it 


reference to baseapp: app is extention of the baseapp 

list of store keys for each module 

list of module's keepers. keepers  handle reads and writes for the module's store(s)

AppCodec: serialization and deserialization of store items 


legacy amino codec : some parts of the cosmos-sdk still use legacy amino codec for backward compatibility

module manager: regester modules msg  and query services arranges execution order for 
functions like InitGenesis, BeginBlock, EndBlock, and preblocker 


# context 

immutable object that contains all information needed to process a request 


convention : if needed to modify, create a child context from its parent

allows modules to easily access their respective stores



# Modules 
application Modules interface: aquired interface for all modules to facilitate the compostion of modules (used by the module manager)

protobuf service :
- Msg- statetransition RPC methods 
  - events - information about a tx execution 
  - Query - query RPC methods

keeper - only way to read/write in amodule store (object capabilities model)


# module - keeper 
type defination consists of :
- key(s) to the module's store(s) in the multistore 
- reference to other module's keepers
- application codec : marshal and unmarshal when reading/writing to the module's store(s)
