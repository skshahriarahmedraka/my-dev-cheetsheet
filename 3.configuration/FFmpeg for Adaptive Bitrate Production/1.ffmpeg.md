small command

```

1. Must include 
   
   ```
   ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264
   verbose_u.mp4 
   ```
2. Drived from input file (if not changing don't need to include)
   
   ```
   -s 1920x1080 -r 24
   ```
3. Default ffmpeg settings (if not changing don't need to include)
   
   ```
   -preset medium  -profile high
   ```
4. Derived from preset (if not changing, don't need to include)
   
   ```
   -bf 3 -b_strategy 1 -refs 3 
   ```
5. derived form output extension (dont need to include in a single pass encode)

```
-f mp4
```

### compare video quality

```



### I frame (intracoded frame)

- its a independent frame , it not produced from any other frame 

- used as the referance frame of other frame 

- preriodically occered , to handle some sudden change 

- collection of I frame is **GOP**

- tipically one **GOP** is 3-12 frame

- compression ratio => 10:1  to 20:1 



### P frame (Predictive frame)

- p frame produced from a I frame or p frame 

- p frame is comes through  encoding and decoding from I or p frame 

- p frame sudden change 

- compression ratio is high

- frame referisment and motion compensation  is consists of p frame

- after compressing p frame carries very less information

- compression rate 20:1 to 30:1



### B frame (Bidirectional predictive frame )

- b frame is only related with the preseding and following i frame and b frame for encoding and decoding

- b cannot contract any other frame not even another b frame

- b frame  has the hight compression ratio 

- compression rate 30:1 to 50:1
