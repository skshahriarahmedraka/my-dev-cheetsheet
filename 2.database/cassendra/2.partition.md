## partitioning concepts
- partitions give you an indication of where your data is in your data model as well as in the cluster 
- Partitions, Partition keys, Composite partition keys, Clustering Columns 


## data types for flexibility
- collections , counters, user defined types
- simplify table design, optimize table functionality store data more efficiently and might change table designs completely


### collections 
- groups and stores data together in a single column 
- collection columns are multi-valued column 
- designed to store a small amout of data 
- retrived in it's entirity
- cannot be a part of primary key, partition key or clustering column
- cannot nest a colleciton inside of another collection
    - unless you use frozen key

#### types of collections 
- set , list , map

##### SET 
- stores the typed collection of unique values 
- stored unordered but returned in sorted order 
```
CREATE TABLE uses (
    id text PRIMARY KEY, 
    fname text,
    lname text, 
    email: set<text>,
);
```

```
INSERT INTO users (id,fname,lname,emails)
    VALUES(
    'case123',
    'cassandra'
    'dev',
    {'sk@gmail','raka@gmail.com'}
)
```

##### LIST 
- groups are stores values in a single cell 
- there can be duplicate 
- stored in aperticular order and retrived acording to an index
```
ALTER TABLE user ADD freq_dest list<text>;

UPDATE user SET freq dest = ('Berlin','London','Dhaka') WHERE id ='3125';
```

##### Map 
- allow to related values to another 
- ordered by unique keys 
- use the set command to enter values
```
ALTER TABLE users ADD todo = map<timestamp,text>;

UPDATE users SET todo = {
    '2018-1-1':'create database'
    
} WHERE id = '523';
```
**Use of FROZEN**
- nest datatypes 
- serialize multiple components into a single value
- values in a FROZEN collection are treated like blobs 
- non-frozen types allow updates to individual fields
