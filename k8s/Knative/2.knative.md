# everything about knative

4 stage of computing 

1. bare metal or physical servers

2. virtualization / VM

3. containers 

4. serverless 

## What is Serverless computing

1. No infratructure  to provision and configure 

2. on- demand execution

3. auto-scaling 

4. per second billing

## what is knative

- set of middleware components built on kubernetes 

- brings serverless computing  to containers and kubernetes 

- simplifies deploying modern application on kubernetes 

- makes cloud native application portable 
  
  - on-premises
  
  - hybrid 
  
  - multi-cloud 

- encourages best practices of desiging and deploying cloud native and serverless applications

## Knative Serving

- Rapid deployment of serverless containers 

- automatic scaling up and down to zero

- routing and network programming for Istio components 

- point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurating

  - revision

## knative eventing

-  loosely coupled event infrastucture for cloud native apps

- Key Components:
  
  - Source (Producer) reads events from the actual source and forwards downstream to channel
  
  - Broker recieves events from  the source, saves to it's underlying storage and fans out to all subcribers
  
  - trigger bridges a broker and a service 
  
  - Service (consumer) is the knative service consuming the event stream

## What is Cloud run ?

- serverless compute platform for containers

- based on Knative - an application platform for kubernetes 

- Scale to zero and scale to an 

- Runs as a standalone execution environment or within GKE

- intregrated logging and monitoring 

- supports synchronous and asynchronous invocation

- Intregration with custom domain and HTTPs

- Changed for resources used , rounded to nearest 100ms



## Google Cloud Run Architechture

- Cloud run -  Developer Experience 

- knative  - platform 

- Kubernetes - infratructure
