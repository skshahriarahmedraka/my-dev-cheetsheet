[HashiCorp Vault - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7iMyoQPMtAP7XeXabzWnNKGkCex1C_3C)

- policy format 

- write policy 

- test policy

- auth method & policy

same policy can be used in different path 

there is  read , write , update  permission 

policies have `.ncl` file extention , `mypolicies.ncl`

sample policy file `my-policies.ncl`

```
path "secret/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["create","update"]
}
path "secret/data/foo" {
    capabilities =["read"]
}
```

### how to list policy

```
vault policy list
```

### how to read policy

```
vault policy read my-policy    
```

### how to delete policy

```
vault policy delete my-policy 
```

### apply a  policy

```
vault policy write my-policy - <<  EOF
path "secret/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["create","update"]
}
path "secret/data/foo" {
    capabilities =["read"]
}
EOF
```

### read policy

```
vault policy read my-policy
```

you need to associate a token with every policy 

### token & policy

```
vault token create 
```

### how to attach token to policy

```
export VAULT_TOKEN="$(vault token create -field token -policy=my-policy)"
```

`vault token create` this command will create token 

`-policy=my-policy`  this command defines policy

how to apply policy when you write secrets

```
vault kv put -mount=secret creds password="my-long-password"
```

here path `secret/data/creds`  wiil use in mount as `-mount=secret creds`

another example 

```
vault kv put -mount=secret foo robot=beepboop
```

## Auth methods & policies

auth method will use external service like aws gcp github for authentication 

### list auth methods

```
vault auth list
```

```
vault auth enable approle
```

`approle` is a custom auth method

command to associate auth method with policies 

```
vault write auth/approle/role/my-role \
    secret_id_ttl=10m \
    token_num_uses= 10 \
    token_ttl=20m \
    token_max_ttl=30m \
    secret_id_num_uses =40 \
    token_polices=my-policy
```

`approle` is the auth method and `my-policy` is the policy

wehave to create `secret id` and `role id` for auth method

commnad to generate secret id 

```
export SECRET_ID=
"$(vault write -f -field=secret_id auth/approle/role/myrole/secret-id)"
```

command to generate role id 

```
export  ROLE_ID=
"$(vault read -field=role_id auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id)"
```

now we can write config 

```
vault write  auth/approle/login role_id="$ROLE_ID" secret_id="$SECRET_ID"
```
