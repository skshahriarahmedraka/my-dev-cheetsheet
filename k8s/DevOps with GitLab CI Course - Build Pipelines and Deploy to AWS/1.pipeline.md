.gitlab-ci.yml

```
test:
    script: echo "hello gitlab ..."
```



```
build laptop:
    image: alpine 
    script: 
        - echo "Building a laptop"
        - mkdir build 
        - touch build/computer.txt
        
```



- if we dont define stages than steps run in parallel 

- we have to specify the `stage`  in every step , which step this belong to 



```
stage :
    - build 
    - test 
variable:
    MY_VAR: raka

build laptop :
    image: alpine 
    stage: build 
    script: 
       - echo "build"
       - touch build/computer.txt
    artifacts:
        paths:
            - build

test laptop:
    image: alpine 
    stage: test 
    script: 
        - echo -f build/computer.txt
```





- **Artifact**  is used for passing one stage data to another , every stage is a independent Docker container



```
build website:
    image: node:16
    script: 
        - yarn install 
        - yarn build
```
