### using port forwarding to access pods

- pods can be accessed in multiple way 

- a very simple wy is by using port forwarding to expose a pod port on the kubectl host that forwards to the pod 
  
  - `kubectl port-forward fwnginx 8080:80`

- port forwarding is used for tesiting pod accessibility on a spedific cluster node , not to expose it to external users 

- regular user access to applications is provided through services and ingress

```
kubectl get pods -o wide 
kubectl run fwnginx --image=nginx:latest
kubectl port-forward fwnginx 8080:80 &
curl localhost:8080
```
