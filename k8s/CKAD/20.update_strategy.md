### understanding update strategy

when a deployment changes , the pods are immediately update according to the update strategy 

- Recreate: all pod are killed and new pods are created. This will lead to temporary unavailability. usefull if you cannot simultaneously run different version of an application

- rollingUpdate: updates pods one at a time to guarantee availablility of the application and you can further tune it's behavior



### understanding rolling update

- it is the task of the deployment to  ensure that enough pods are running at all times 

- so when making a change this change is applied as a rolling update: the changed version is deployed in a new replicaSet 

- After the update has been confirmed as successful, the old version ReplicaSet is scaled to 0 to deactivate 

- you can use `kubectl rollout history` to get details about recent transaction 

- use `kubectl  rollout undo` to undo a previous change  



### using rolling update options

the rolling update options are used  to guarantee a certain minimal and maximal number of pods to be always available

- maxUnavilable : determines the maximum number of pods that are upgraded at the sametime 

- maxSurge: the number of pods  what can run beyond the desired nubmer of pods as specified in a replica to guarantee minimal availability 

```
kubectl get deploy bluelabel -o yaml 
kubectl scale deploy bluelabel --replicas=4
kubectl set env deploy bluelabel type=blended
kubectl get all --selector app=bluelabel
```
