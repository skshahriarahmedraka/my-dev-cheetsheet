### understanding deployment

- the deployment is the standard for running application in kubernetes 

- it offer features that add to the scalability and reliability of the application
  
  - Scalability: scaling the number of application instances 
  
  - Updates and update strategy :  zero-downtime application update 

- it protects pods and wil automatically restart them if anything goes wrong 

- use `kubectl create deploy` to create deployment 

```
kubectl create deployment myweb --image=nginx --replicas=3 
kubectl describe deploy myweb
kubectl get all 
kubectl delete pod myweb-xxx-yyy
kubectl get all 
kubectl run pod mypod --image=nginx
kubectl delete pod mypod 
kubectl get all
```

```
kubectl create deployment myweb --image=nginx --replicas=3 


kubectl describe deployments.apps myweb
```

### Understanding Deployment scalability

- in very old versions of kubernetes the deployment  did not exist 

- to manage scalability , the replica set resource was used 

- with introduction of  the apps API extention the deployment was introduced 

- from the moment, scalability was managed in the deployment and no longer in the replicaSet 

- To mange scalability however , the development creates a replicaSet 

- Do Not mange ReplicaSet directly, manage through the Deployment only 

### Manually managing Scalabiliy

- use `kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=4` to scale the number of currently running replicas 

- Alternatively use `kubectl edit deployment my-deployment` to edit the number of replicas manually  
  
  - notice that `kubectl edit` allows modification of limited number of options only 

- to start a deployment with a spedific number of replicas , use `kubectl create deploy ... --replicas=3`

```
kubectl api-resources | less
```

`redis-deployment.yml`

```

```



```
kubectl edit deployments.apps redis 

kubectl get all
kubectl get all --selector app=redis



```



```
kubectl get all --selector app=redis
// if we delete kubernetes will recreate the pods 
```



### understanding deployment updates

- using deployments allow for zero downtime application updates 

- updates are usd to change different parts of deployment 
  
  - image version 
  
  - any parameter that can be used with `kubectl set` 

- when an update is applied a new replicaset is created with new properties 
  
  - pods with the new properties are started in a new ReplicaSet 
  
  - after successful updates, the old replicaSet is no longer used and may be deleted 
  
  - the `deployment.spec.revisionHistoryLimit` is set to keep the 10 last replicasets 

- the `updateStrategy` deployment property defines how to handle updates



commands :

```
kubectl create deploy nginxup --image=nginx:1.14
kubectl get all --selector app=nginxup
kubectl set image deploy nginx nginx=nginx:1.17
kubectl get all --selector app=nginxup 
```
