### understanding deployment

- the deployment is the standard for running application in kubernetes 

- it offer features that add to the scalability and reliability of the application
  
  - Scalability: scaling the number of application instances 
  
  - Updates and update strategy :  zero-downtime application update 

- it protects pods and wil automatically restart them if anything goes wrong 

- use `kubectl create deploy` to create deployment 

```
kubectl create deployment myweb --image=nginx --replicas=3 
kubectl describe deploy myweb
kubectl get all 
kubectl delete pod myweb-xxx-yyy
kubectl get all 
kubectl run pod mypod --image=nginx
kubectl delete pod mypod 
kubectl get all
```

```
kubectl create deployment myweb --image=nginx --replicas=3 


kubectl describe deployments.apps myweb
```



### Understanding Deployment scalability

- in very old versions of kubernetes the deployment  did not exist 

- to manage scalability , the replica set resource was used 

- with introduction of  the apps API extention the deployment was introduced 

- from the moment, scalability was managed in the deployment and no longer in the replicaSet 

-  To mange scalability however , the development creates a replicaSet 

- Do Not mange ReplicaSet directly, manage through the Deployment only 



### Manually managing Scalabiliy

- use `kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=4` to scale the number of currently running replicas 

- Alternatively use `kubectl edit deployment my-deployment` to edit the number of replicas manually  
  
  - notice that `kubectl edit` allows modification of limited number of options only 
    
     

- to start a deployment with a spedific number of replicas , use `kubectl create deploy ... --replicas=3`



```
kubectl api-resources | less
```



`redis-deployment.yml`
