```

## kubernetes essenticals

### pod

- A Pod is an abstraction of server   within a single namespace , exposed by  single ip address

- The Pod is the minimal entity that  can be managed by kubernetes 

- from a container perspective  a  pod is a entity that runs typically one or more container by using container images

- typically pods are only started  through a deployment, because "naked" pods are not scheduled in case of a node failure 

- in CKAD , you will have to deal with naked pods

- naked pods are not rescheduled  in case of failure 

- rolling updates dont apply to naked pods you can only bring it down and bring it up again with new  settings

- naked pods cannot be scaled 

- naked pods cannot be replaced automatically

```
minikube kubectl -- get pods -A
// get all the pod present inside the minikub    
```

```
kubectl run mynginx --image=nginx
// run the pod

kubectl get pods -o yaml   

// see the yaml file of that pod 

kubectl describe pods mynginx
// get detail of pods
```

```
kubectl get pods

kubectl get pods mynginx -o yaml
```

## Yaml

- YAML is a human readable data serialization language

- it is perfect for devops to create input files to manage object into dofferent systems like kubernetes and ansible

- it uses identation to identify relations 

- when combined with github it's an excellent way to manage and update configuration in a structurecd way

All of the YAML manifest ingredients  are defined in the api

- apiVersion: specify which version of the api to use for this object 

- kind : indicates the type of object (Deployment, Pod etc)

- metadata: contains administrative information about the object

- spec:  contains the specifics for the object 

Use `kubectl explain` to get more information about the basic properties

## Spec

in the container spec, different  parts are needed

- name:  the name of the container 

- image: the image that should be used

- command: the command the container should run 

- args: arguments that are used by  the commnad

- env: environment variables that should be used by container

there are all part of the `pod.spec.container.spec` which can be checked with `kubectl explain` 

expample  yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name:mypod
    namespae: default
spec:
    containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: busybox
      command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
```

learn 

```
kubectl explain pod


kubectl explain pod.spec | less

kubectl explain --recursive pod.spec | less
```

## create busy box k8s pod

for busybox `deployment.yaml`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: busybox
    namespae: default
spec:
    containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: busybox
      command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
```

now deploy this in k8s

```
kubectl create -f busybox.yaml
kubectl get pods


kubectl delete -f busybox.yaml
kubectl apply -f busybox.yaml  
// apply command create if not exist & apply changes if there is any
```
