### understanding ingress class

- Ingress Class is a relatively new resource which can be used to set a specific ingress controller as the cluster default 

- each ingress resource should specify a class which revers to cluster default ingress class 





### understanding and configuring network policies

- by default there are no restrictions to network trafic in k8s 

- pods can always communicate even if there are in othere namespace 

- to limit this, network policies can be used 

- network policies need to be supported by the network plugin though 

- if in a policy there is no match traffic will be denied 

- if no network policy is used , all traffic is allowed 



### changing the network plugin on minikube

- by default , minikube comes without a network plugin 

- use the `--cni= calio` option to `minikube start` to start minikube  with the calio plugin 

- to verify if the calico agent is used , use `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`

- if it's not used yet use the following to restart minikube with the calico plugin
  
  - `minkube stop`
  
  - `minikube delete `
  
  - `minikube start --cni=calico`



### network policy identifiers

- when defining a pod or namespace based **NetworkPolicy** , a selector label is used to specify what traffic is allowed to and pods that match the selector 

- In Network Policies , three different can be used to match network traffic 
  
  - podSelector: allow access to a pod with the corresponding selector label 
  
  - namespaceSelector: allow incomming traffic from namespaces with the matching selector label 
  
  - ipBlock: used to specify a range of cluster external IPs that should get access 

- Network Policies donot confict they are additive 

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
- if required: minikube stop; minikube delete; minikube start --cni=calico
- if required: kubectl get pods -n kube-system 
kubectl apply -f nwpolicy-complete-example.yaml 
kubectl exec -it busybox -- wget -- spider --timeout=1 nginx 
kubectl label pod busybox access=true 
kubectl exec -it busybox -- wget --spider --timeout=1 nginx 
```
