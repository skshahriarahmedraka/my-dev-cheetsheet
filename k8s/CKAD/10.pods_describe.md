- use `kubectl describe pod podname-xxx` to see all these parameters are there current setting as they currently  are in the etcd 

- use documentation at kubernetes.io for more info

### conecting to a pod for further inspection

apart from exploring a pod externally you can also connect to it and run command on the primary conatainer in a pod 

- `kubectl exec -it nginx-xxx -- sh`

- from here , run any command to investigate 

- use exit to disconnect 



```
kubectl get pods

kubectl get pods my-nginx -o json | less

kubectl get pods my-nginx -o yaml | less


```



explain any field of yaml file 

```
kubectl pods.spec.enableServiceLinks
```

describe pod

```
kubectl describe pod mynginx
```



```
kubectl exec -it mynginx -- sh
```

after access to the pod sh shell
