- minikube is an all in one kubernetes solution

- typically , controller and worker functionality are offered in one virtual machine 

- to run minikube in a virtual machine you need a virtualization layer to be present and configured 

## inside ubuntu virtual os

```
lscpu | less
```

```
df -h
```

```
free -m
```

## minikube

```
minikube start --vm-driver=docker 
```

```
minikube status
```

```
kubectl get all
```

```
minikube ssh // logs in to the minikube host
docker ps // shows all docker  processes on the minikube host      
```

```
dashboard 
delete 
ip
start 
stop 
status
version
ssh
```

### delete  a deployment

```
kubectl delte deploy myeasyapp
```

```
kubectl completion -h  
// run the example && also add `  source '$HOME/.kube/completion.bash.inc'
`  to the bashrc
```

`kubectl completion` is a command that generates shell completion scripts for the `kubectl` command-line tool

Once you have sourced the completion script, you can use the `kubectl` command with the Tab key to auto-complete command names, subcommands, 
and options, making it easier and faster to use Kubernetes commands.

### see run help

```
kubectl run -h
```

run nginx

```
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```

```
kubectl get all
```
