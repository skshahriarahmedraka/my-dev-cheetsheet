### understanding Ingress

- Ingress is used to provide external access to internal kubernetes cluster resources 

- to do so , Ingress used a load balancer that is present on external cluster 

- this load balancer is implemented by the ingress controller 

- As an API resource, Ingress uses selector label to connect to Pods that are used as a service endpoint 

- to access resources in the cluster , DNS must be configured to resolved to the ingress load balancer IP



### understanding Ingress

- Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside  the cluster to services within the cluster 

- traffic routing is controlled by routes defined on the ingress resource 

- Ingress canbe configured to do the following 
  
  - give service externally reachable urls 
  
  - load balance traffic 
  
  - terminate SSL/TLS 
  
  - offer name based virtual hosting

- creating ingress resources without ingress controller has no effect 

- many ingress controllers exist
  
  - nginx ; kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/
