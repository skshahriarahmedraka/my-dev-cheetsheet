### understanding service ports

- while working with services,different ports are specified 

- `targetport` : the port on the application (container)  with the service address 

- `port` the port on which the service accessible 

- `nodeport`  : the port that is exposed externally while using  nodePort service type 

```
kubectl  create deployemnt nginxsvc --image= nginx

kubectl  scale deployment nginxsvc --replicas=3 
kubectl expose deployment nginxsvc --port=80

kubectl describe svc nginxsvc 
# look for end points 

kubectl get svc nginx -o=yaml 
kubectl get svc 

kubectl get endpoints 
```



#### accessing application using services

```
minikube ssh 
curl http://svc-ip-address 
exit 
kubectl edit svc nginxsvc 
....
    protocol: TCP 
    nodePort : 32000
    type: NodePort 
- kubectl get svc 
- (from host) : curl http://$(minikube ip): 32000 
```





## managing networking (Using service resources in microservices)

- in microservices architechture , different frontend and backend pods are used to provide the application 

- backend Pods (databases) can be exposed internally only, using the clusterIP service type 

- Frontend Pods (web servers) can be exposed for external access, using the nodePort service type



### Understanding service and DNS

- Exposed services automatically register with the kubernetes internal  DNS 

- With services exposing themselves on dynamic ports , resolving service names can be challenging 

- As a solution, the coreDNS service is included by default in kubernetes and this DNS service is updated everytime a new service is added 

- As a result, DNS name lookup from within one pod to any exposed service happend automatically 



```
kubectl run testpod --image=busybox -- sleep 3600 

kubectl get svc 


kubectl get svc,pods -n kube-system  


kubectl exec -it textpod -- cat /etc/resolv.conf 

kubectl exec -it testpod -- nslookup nginxsvc 
```
