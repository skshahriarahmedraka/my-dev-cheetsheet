## Podman

- with the lanchog RHEL 8 , red hat started offering  podman as an alternative to Docker 
  
  - podman runs containers without the need of having a daemon directly on top of the CRI-O container runtime
  
  - **buildah** is the realted service  that is used for managing container images

## registry

- docker hub, quay.io

- docker no longer supported  on RedHat 

- to use container on RHEL 8 and related distribution , use podman instead of docker

- use `dnf install -y container-tools`  to install podman and realted utilities

## RHEL  8  podman

```
podman run -it ubuntu:latest
```

```
podman ps  // same as docker ps
```

```
sudo dnf install podman-docker 


// you  can use docker commnd as usual
```

## understanding image

- A container image basically is a tar file with associated meta data

- To Build container images in an efficient way it typically consistes of multiple layers 

- while building an image a base image is used 

- on the top of the base system  image  the application is install as an additional  layer



`docker image ls` shows images  stored including version information using tags

`docker image rm`

`docker history <imageID>`

`docker history image:tag`



`docker tag mariadb localhost:5000/mariadb:latest`



### two way to create docker file

- Using a running container  : a container is started and modifications are applied to the container . the docker  commit command is used  to write modifications

- Using a docker file: a docker file contains instructions for building an image
