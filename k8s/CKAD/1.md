## Podman

- with the lanchog RHEL 8 , red hat started offering  podman as an alternative to Docker 
  
  - podman runs containers without the need of having a daemon directly on top of the CRI-O container runtime
  
  - **buildah** is the realted service  that is used for managing container images

## registry

- docker hub, quay.io



- docker no longer supported  on RedHat 

- to use container on RHEL 8 and related distribution , use podman instead of docker

- use `dnf install -y container-tools`  to install podman and realted utilities
