#### uderstand k8s objects

- k8s works with objects

- - pods , deployment, services, volume
  
  - objects can be created in two ways , imperatively or declaratively

### the "Pod" Object

the smallest "unit" kubernetes interract with 

- containers and runs one or multiple containers 
  
  - most common use is "one container per pod" 

- pod contains shared resources (e.g.  volumes) for all pod containers

- Has a cluster- internal IP by default 
  
  - Containers inside a pod can communicate via "localhost"



pods are designed to be ephemeral : kubernetes will start ,stop replace them as needed

for pods to be managed for you need a container (deployment)
