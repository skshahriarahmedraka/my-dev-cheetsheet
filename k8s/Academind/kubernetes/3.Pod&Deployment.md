#### understand k8s objects

- k8s works with objects

- - pods , deployment, services, volume
  
  - objects can be created in two ways , imperatively or declaratively

### the "Pod" Object

the smallest "unit" kubernetes interract with 

- containers and runs one or multiple containers 
  
  - most common use is "one container per pod" 

- pod contains shared resources (e.g.  volumes) for all pod containers

- Has a cluster- internal IP by default 
  
  - Containers inside a pod can communicate via "localhost"

pods are designed to be ephemeral : kubernetes will start ,stop replace them as needed

for pods to be managed for you need a container (deployment)

#### the "Deployemenent" Object

Controls (multiple) Pods

- you set a desired state kubernetes then changes the actual state 
  
  - define which pods are containers to run and the number of instances 

- deployment can be paused , deleted and rolled back 

- Deployment can be scalled dinamically (and automatically)
  
  - you can change the number of desired pods as needed

deployment managed a pod for you , you can also create multiple depolyments

you therefore typically dont directly control pods , instead you use deployment to set up the desired end state

### create deployment

// error

```//
kubectl create deployment first-deploy-app --image=kub-first-app
```

```
kubectl get pods // all the pod are not running
```

`--image=kub-first-app` this command runs inside k8s cluster . which runs on a virtual machine . so this look image in remote container repository

```
kubectl delete deployment first-deploy-app 
// delete the deployed deployment
```

create docker image in docker hub `kub-first-app`

link the local docker image to docker hub repo 

```
docker tag kub-first-app academind/kub-first-app
docker push academind/kub-first-app 
```

now kubectl deployment will work 

```
kubectl create deployment first-deploy-app --image=academind/kub-first-app


kubectl get deployments  // now containers are running
```

```
kubectl dashboard
```

### behind the scene

- `kubectl create deployment --image=...`
  
  - master node (control plane) - scheduler analyes currently running pods and finds the best node for the new pod(s)
    
    - worker node - kubelet manages the pod and containers 
      
      - pod(container)  from [ -- image=... ]

### The "Service" Object

Expose Pods to the  cluster or externally 

- pods have an internal IP by default - it changes when a pod is replaced - (finding a pod is hard if the IP changes all the time )

- service group pods with a shared IP

- Service can allow external access to pods- by default (internal only) can be over written 

without service, pods are very hard to reach and communication is difficult

reaching a pod from outside the cluster is not possible at all without services

expose  cluster

`--type=ClusterIP` `--type=NodePort` `--type=LoadBalancer`

```
kubectl expose deployment first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

get the list of services 

```
kubectl get services 
```

for getting externer ip

```
minikube service first-app
```

now we will get a address to view the application

if we stop a  node js  server by 

```
app.get("/error",(req,res)=>{
    process.exit(1)
}) // this will crush the running container
```

set a scaling size 

```
kubectl scale develoyment/first-app --replicas=3

kubectl get pods // we will see 3 pods
```

### make change in code and rebuild docker image

```
docker build -t academind/kub-first-app .


docker push academind/kub-first-app
```

now update k8s image with latest image now update k8s image with latest image 

```
kubectl set image deployment/first-app 
    kub-first-app=academind/kub-first-app
```

K8s dont stop the current running pods if the set image command fails 

check the running pods 

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/first-app
```

undo the rollout 

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app
```

we can use deployment history for go to any deployment 

```
kubectl rollout history deployment
```

```
kubectl rollout history deployment/first-app --revision=1
// here 1 is the first deployment of the cluster
```

delete k8s service & deployment 

```
kubectl delete service first-app

kubectl delete deployment first-app
```
