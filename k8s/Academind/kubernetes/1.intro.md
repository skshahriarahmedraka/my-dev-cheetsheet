## k8s

    container orchestration

## we (may be) have a problem

    manual deployment of container is hard to maintain , error-prone 
    and annoying(even beyond security and configuration concerns)
    - container might crush/go down and need to replaced
    - we might need more contaienr instances upon traffic spikes
    - incoumming traffic should be distributed equally

## AWS ECS

    - container health check + autometic redeployment
    - auto scaling 
    - load balancer
    - configaration is ECS specifc

## kubernetes

    an opensource system(and de-facto standard) for orchestration container deployments
    - automatic deployment 
    - scaling and load balacing 
    - management

## what is k8s and what is not

    its not a cloud service 
    -it's a opensource project
    
    it's not a service by any specific cloud service provider 
    - it can be used by any cloud service provider
    
    it's not resticted to any specific (cloud) service provider 
    - it can be used with any provider
    
    it's not just a software you run on some machine 
    - it's a collection of concept and tools 
    
    it's not a alternative to docker
    - it't works with  containers (like docker,cri-o, container d)
    
    it's not a paid service 
    -it's a free opensource project

# k8s is like docker compose for multiple machines

## core kubernetes concept & architecture

    Cloud provider Api 
        Master Node
            - various components which help with managing the worker nodes 
            - controll plane 
            - the master node controls your development(i.e. all worker nodes)
                -- worker node (like a virtual os)
                    - worker nodes run the container of your application
                    - nodes are your machines / virtual instances
                    proxy/config
                    pod(container)
                    - multiple pods can be created and removed to scale your app

## what you need to do for k8s

    - create the cluster and node instances(worker+master nodes)
    - setup API Server, kubelet and other kubernetes services/software on nodes 
    - Create other (cloud) provider resources that might be needed(e.g. load balancer,filesystem)

## what k8s will do

    - create your objects(e.g. pods)  and manage them 
    - monitor pods and recreate them scale pods etc
    - kubenetes utilizes the provided (cloud ) resources to apply your configuration / goals

## close look at worker node

    worker node
        // worker node is managed by the master node
        // worker node think of it as one computer/machine/virtual
     instance    
        - kubelet
            // communication between worker node and master node
        - docker
        - kube-proxy
            // manage node and pod network communication
        - pod (volume, containers)
            // host one or more application containers and their resources 
    (volumes,ip,run config)
            // pods are created and managed by kubernetes

## Master node (interact with cloud provider api)

    master node
        - api server
            // api for the kubekets to communicate
        - scheduler
            // watches for new pods selects worker nodes to run them on
        - kube controller manager
            // watches and controlls worker nodes correct number of pods 
    and more
        - cloud controller manager
            // like kube-conroller-manger but for a specific cloud 
    provider ; knows how to interact with cloud provider resources

## core concept

    cluster 
        // a set of node machines which are running the containerized 
        application(worker nodes) or  control other nodes (master node)
    nodes 
        // physical or virtual machine with a certain hardware capacity 
        which host on or mulpiple pods and communicates with the cluster
    
        - master node
            // cluster control plane , managing the pods across worker 
        nodes
        - worker node
            // host pods , running app Containers (+resources)
        pods
        // pods holds ,actual running app containers+ their required 
        resources(i.e volumes)
    container 
        // normal docker container
        services 
        // a logical set(group) of pods with a unique, pod and container 
        independent ip address        

## installation

    kubectl 
        // a tool for sending instructinos to the cluster 
    (e.g a new deployment)
