## S: Single Responsibility

- one class should have only one responsibility 

- should not be filled with excessive functionality

- if there is a **student class**  has  **send email** ,**enroll course** .  the service should be in different class ,like **Send Email class** , **course enroll class** . this way the code can be reusagable 

- Single Responsibility  != single job  ,  this means every thing it does is close related

## O: Open Close Principles

- open to extensing but close to modification 

- adding new functionality without changing existing methods . 

- one way to achieve this is **Decorator pattern**

- you can use extention methods 

## L: Liskov Substitution

- child class should be able to do every thing that parent class can

- this means that every subclass or derived class should be substiture for their base or parent class 

- for exmple we create  a **human class**  and a **parent class**,**Child class**

## I: Interface Segregation

- interfaces forces the class to implement methods

- interface shouldnot force classes to implement what they can't do

- large interfaces should be devided into small ones

- repository patern helps to build this

## D: Dependency Inversion

- High level modules shouldn't  depend on low level modules. The should both depend on abstruction

- if the **service class** need to call some thing in database . you can create a new repository class directly inside service. then the **service class** dependent upon low level components .   on other way we can create  repository interface inside service class
