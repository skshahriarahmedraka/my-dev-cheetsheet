## **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**



The DCT is used to convert data in the pixel domain to the frequency domain to reveal insights about the image or video frame.



Examples of transforms include the

- Discrete cosine transform
- Discrete sine transform
- Wavelet transforms
- Fourier transforms
- Laplace transforms
- Z-transforms
