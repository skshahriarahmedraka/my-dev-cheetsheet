Per-title encoding is the science of tuning of the ABR bitrate 
ladder for each movie based on its unique spatial & temporal nature 
and complexity to save bitrate, storage space, and ABR transmission 
bandwidth. In other words, the aim of per-title encoding is to generate a
 different set of encoding or compression parameters for every movie 
based on its characteristics (slow-moving, sports, anime, cartoon 
content, etc.)
