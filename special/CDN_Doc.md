# 1. Create Certificate

## Add an SSL certificate to deliver content via HTTPS protocol.

Paste all strings of the certificate(s) and the private key in one string parameter. Each certificate in chain and the private key should be divided with the "\n" symbol like in the example.
Also you can add a Let's Encrypt certificate. In this case you don't need to provide certificate and private key, it will be generated automatically after attaching this certificate to your resource. See the request body schema below

--- 

## MY:

## Add an SSL Certificate(proprietary) to deliver content via HTTPS protocol.

---

**Description:**

This API endpoint allows you to add an **SSL certificate**  for delivering content via the HTTPS protocol. You can provide your own certificate and private key or there is a option for a hassle-free experience with [**Let's Encrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org/), which automatically generates the *certificate* and *private key* upon attachment to your resource.

---

**Request Body Schema:**

- To manually provide a certificate and private key, concatenate all strings into a single parameter. Each certificate in the chain and the private key should be separated by the "\n" symbol.

- If you choose to use  Let's Encrypt, checkout `POST /distributions/<distribution_id>/letsencrypts-request` and `POST /distributions/<distribution_id>/letsencrypts-verify`

**Note:** Inside request `JSON`  Ensure that the provided strings follow the specified format and include the necessary line breaks ("\n") for proper processing.

**request json description**

1. **`name`**: 
   
   - This is a user-defined name or identifier for the certificate. I

2. **`type`**: 
   
   - The type of certificate. In this case,for a example it's specified as "gotipath."  

3. **`certificate_type`**: 
   
   - Indicates that if the certificate  is a part of a **wildcard** or **multi-domain certificate** or **single**

4. **`certificate_body`**: 
   
   - Contains the actual certificate body (public key certificate) . This includes information about the entity, the public key, and the digital signature from the Certificate Authority (CA).

5. **`certificate_private_key`**: 
   
   - Contains the private key associated with the certificate. The private key is kept confidential and is used for decrypting data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key.

6. **`certificate_chain`**: 
   
   - Represents the certificate chain, including one or more intermediate certificates . This chain is used to establish a trust relationship from the server's certificate to the root certificate.
