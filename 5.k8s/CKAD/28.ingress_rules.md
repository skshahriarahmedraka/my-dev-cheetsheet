### Understanding ingress rules

each ingress rule contains the following 

- an optional host. if no host is specified the rule applies to all inbound HTTP traffic 

- A list of path (like/ test path). Each path hash it's own backend path canbe exposed as a POSIX regular expression

- the backend which consists of either a service or a resource it is common to configure a default backend in an Ingress controller for infomming traffic that doesn't match a specific path

- a service backend relates to a kubernetes service 

- a resource backend typically revers to cloud based object storage , where ingress is used to provide access to storage resources 
  
  - see ingress-resource.yml in the course git repo for an example 

- Resource backend and service backend are  mutually exclusive 

- a default backend canbe set to handle traffic that doesn't del with any specific backend 

- ingress backend by a single service : there  is a one rule that defines access to one backend service 
  
  - `kubectl create ingress single --rule="/files=fileservice:80"`

- Simple fanout: there are two or more rules defining different paths that refer to different services 
  
  - ```
    kubectl create ingress single --rule="/file=filesservice:80" \
    --rule="/db=dbservice:80"
    ```

- Name-based virtual hosting: there are two or more rules that route requests based on the host header
  
  - make sure there is a DNS entry for each host header
  
  - ```
    kubect create ingress multihost \
     --rule="my.example.com/files*=filesservice:80" \
    -- rule ="my.example.org/data*=dataservice:80"
    ```
  
  - 

### name based virtual hosting image ingress

```
kubectl create deploy mars --image=nginx 
kubectl create deploy saturn --image=httpd 
kubectl exposed deploy mars --port= 80 
kubectl exposed deploy saturn --port=80
```

add entries to `/etc/hosts`

- `$(minikube ip) mars.example.com`

- `$(minikube ip)` saturn.example.com

```
kubectl creat ingress multihost --rule="mars.example.com/=mars:80"
--rule="saturn.example.com/=satuen:80"


kubectl edit ingress multihost
# change pathType to Prefix 


curl saturn.example.com; curl mars.example.com 
```
