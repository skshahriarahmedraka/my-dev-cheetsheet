### understanding labels

- a label is a key value pair that provides additional information about kubernetes resources 

- labels are used a lot  in kubernetes

- labels are set in resources like deployments and services and use selectors a connect to related resources 

- the deployment find it's pods using a selector 

- the service find its enndpoint pods using a selector 

- administrator can manually set labels to facilitate resource management and selection 

- to find all resources matching a specific label, use `--selctor key=value`



### understanding auto created labels

- Deployments created with `kubectl create` automatically get a lebel `app=appname`

- Pods started with `kubectl run` automatically get a label `run=podname` 



### Understanding anotation

- annotations were originally used to provide detailed metadata in a object 

- annotations cannot be used in queries

- think of information about licenses, maintainer and more 

- Recently introduced resources may use annotations to provide additional function information about the resources 



```
kubectl create deploy bluelabel --image=nginx


kubectl label deployment bluelabel state=demo


kubectl get deployments --show-labels 


kubectl get deployment --selector state=demo


kubectl get all --show-labels

kubectl get all --show-labels --selector state=demo


kubectl describe deployments.apps bluelabel


kubectk label pod bluelabel-2546253 app-


kubectl get all --show-labels
