### Understanding Resource limitation

- by default , a pod will use as much CPU and memory as necessary to do it's work 

- this can be managed by using  Memory/CPU request limits in `pod.spec.containers.resources`

- A request in an initial requst  for resources 

- A limit defines the upper threshold of resources a Pod can use

------------

- Memory as well as CPU limits can be used 

- CPU limits are expressed in millioncore or millicpu, 1/1000 of a CPU core
  
  - so 500 millicore is 0.5 CPU

- when being scheduled , the kube-scheduler ensures that the node running the pods has all requested resources available 

- if  a Pod with resource limits cannot be scheduled it will show a status of pending

---

- when using a deployment , use `kubectl set resources` to change resource limitation on running applications

- this doesn't work on Pods, as Pod don't provide an update mechanism 

- Pod /deployment resource limitations can be combined with quota on namespace to restrict these applications in specific namespaces only 
  
  - manageing namespace quota is covered in CKA

```
kubectl create -f frontend-resources.yml
kubectl get pods 
kubectl describe pod frontend
kubectl delete -f frontend-resources.yml
```

[Resource Quotas | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)

`quota.yml`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: List
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: pods-high
  spec:
    hard:
      cpu: "1000"
      memory: 200Gi
      pods: "10"
    scopeSelector:
      matchExpressions:

```

```
kubectl create -f frontend-resources.yml 
kubectl get pods 
kubectl describe pod frontend 
kubectl delete -f frontend-resource.yml
```

status : OOMKilled   -  out of memory error 

```
kubectl descrive pod frontend

kubectl logs frontend db  
// logs of container db inside pod frontend 
```

see the available memory for minikube 

```
kubectl describe nodes minikube 
```

### Clean Up resources

- resources are not autometically cleaned up 

- some resources have options for automatic cleanup if there are no longer used 

- priodica manual cleanup may be required 

- if a pod is managed by deployments, the deployment must be removed, not the the pod 

- try not to force resource to deletion , it may bring them in a unmanagable state 

```
kubectl delete all 
kubectl delete all --all 
kubectl delete all --force --grace-priod=-1


Dont do this :  kubectl delete all --all -A --force --grace-priod=-1
```

```
kubectl get pods -A
// see all the running an pending pods 

kubectl delete all --all 
```
