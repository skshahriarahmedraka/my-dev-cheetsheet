### understanding service



- A service an api resource that  is used to expose a logical set of pods 

- services are applying round-robin load balancing to forward traffic to specific pods 

- the set of pods that is targeted by a service is determined by a selector (which is a lable )

- the kube-control-manager will continuously scan for pods that match the selector and include these in the service 

- if pods are added or removed , they imediately show up in the service 

### service decoupling

- services exist independently from the applications they provide access to 

- the only thing they do , is watch for pods that have a specific label set matching the selector that is specified in the service 

- that means that one service can provide access to pods in multiple deployments and while doing so, kubernetes will automatically load balance between these pods

### service and kube proxy

- the kube-proxy agent on the nodes watches the kubernetes api for new service and endpoints 

- after creation , it opens random ports and listen for traffic to the service port on the cluster IP address and next redirects trafic to a pod that is specified as an end point

- the kube-proxy works in the background and normally doesn't requires any configuration



### understanding service types

to match networking needs in different environments , different service types are available 

- ClusterIP : the default type exposes the service on an internal cluster IP address 

- NodePort: allocates a specific node port on the node that forward to the service cluster IP address 

- Loadbalancer: currently only implemeted in public cloud 

- externalName : works on DNS names ; redirection is happening at a DNS level useful in migration 

for CKAD focus on CLusterIP and NodePort
