### manage jobs

- pods normally are created to run forever 

- to create a pod that runs up to completion use jobs instead 

- jobs are useful for one shot task , like backup,calculation, batch processing and more 

- use spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished to clean up completed jobs automatically



### Understanding job types

3 differnet job types can bes started which is specified by the **completion** and **parallelism** parameters 

- non-parallel jobs: one pod is started, unless the pod fails 
  
  - completions=1
  
  - parallelism=1 

- parallel jobs with a fixed completion count: the job is complete after successfully running as many times as specified in `jobs.spec.completions`
  
  - completions=n 
  
  - parallelism=m 

- parallel jobs with a work queue; multiple jobs are started when completes successfully, the job is complete 
  
  - completions=1
  
  - parallelism =n

### Demo: using Jobs



```
kubectl create job onejob --image=busybox -- date


kubectl get jobs 
kubectl get pods 
kubectl get jobs,pods
kubectl get pods onejob-xxx | grep restartPolicy 
kubectl get jobs -o yaml | grep -B 5 restartPolicy

kubectl delete jobs.batch onejob 
kubectl create jobs mynewjob --image=busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml


kubectl create job mynewjob --image=busybox --dry-run=client  \
-o yaml -- sleep 5 > mynewjob.yml
```

edit `mynewjob.yml`  , add  `completion: 3 ` `ttlSecondAfterFinished:60`

```
kubectl create -f mynewjob.yml 

kubectl get jobs,pods
```
