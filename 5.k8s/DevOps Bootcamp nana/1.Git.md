delete branch 

```
git branch -d  [branchName]
```

if the remote git repo has extra commit , you have to pull the commit first and make your commit stack after that 

command to do that 

```
git pull -r  
// git pull rebase 
// remote commit will placed before your commit 
// your commit will be in head
```

if git rebase shows conflict , you have to manually check and manage those conflict 

then     

```
git rebase --continue 
```

remove a  file from git cache . it will not track that flle any more

```
git rm -r --cached [fileName]
```

keep some changes in stash but not want to commit 

```
git stash 
// it will keep the changes in stash but wont commit 
// do any git command after that 
//for get the stash back go back to that branch 
git stash pop 
//  get back the changes
```

undo commits 

- git reset --hard and --soft 

- git revert 

Changing commits 

- git commit --amend

### move back one commit , undo the latest commit

```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
// here HEAD number is the number of commit you want to go back
// latest commit will completely removed 
//after that you have to push force 
git push --force
```

### move back to the commit  and keep the latest commit as file changes

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1 
// same as without --soft 
    
```

## The git commit --amend command is **a convenient way to modify the most recent commit**

```
git commit --amend
```

### `git revert <commit hash>`

- creates a new commit to revert the old commit's changes 

### `git reset <commit hash>`

- removed old commit 

### before creating changes to the master branch , pull the master branch to that branch and test the code

```
// from "update" branch 
git merge master
// master will marge with "update" branch
```

The `revert` command will create a commit that reverts the changes of the commit being targeted.

```

```
