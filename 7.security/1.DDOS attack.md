## DDOS attack

1. volume based 
   
   1. bits per second 
   - types 
   
   - icmp flood attack 
   
   - UDP flood attack 
   
   - spoofed packet attack

2. protocol/network layer
   
   1. high number of packet on network infrastructure 
   - Types
   
   - syn floods
   
   - smurf 

3. application layer
   
   1. http  get post  request 







## volumetric/network based attack

these attack focus on consuming all the bandwith allocated to server. a huge volume of request are send to the server which warrarnt a reply from ther server and  block all the bandwith for regular users . 

example- UDP floods, ICMP echo request



## Protocol based attack

these cosume the actual resources of a target by exhusting the firewalls and load balancers kept in place. Layer three and four of OSI model and compromised 

example - SYN flooding , ping of death





## application based attack

sophisticaed attacks that crash the entire by targeting application and OS level vulnerabilities it can stop specific applciations from delivering necessary information 



example- http flooding, BGP hijacking
